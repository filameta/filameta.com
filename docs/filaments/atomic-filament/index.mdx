From the company:

> Top tier, made in USA, 3-D printer filament for professionals and hobbyists.

Atomic Filament primarily focuses on PLA, PETG, ABS/ASA filaments, with PETG-CF being their flagship product. Their "normal" PLA is closer to PLA+ (PLA with additives), with their MeltMiser Economy being closest to "normal" PLA. They also call their PETG, "Pro", so it's assumed to have additives (but verification is needed).

One of their largest standouts is their "Made in America" labeling. The company claims that all materials are American-made - this includes the spools and filament (including the raw resin and colors). But ignoring that label, Atomic Filament boasts impressive tolerances, comparable or exceeding the space-leader, Prusament - so the higher than average costs are mostly justified - but hey, free shipping.
